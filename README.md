# FileSharingHomelab

 ### [Pictoral Walkthrough Demonstration]

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
   For this lab we will not get into how to install virtual box or Active Directory. Oracle Box should be downloaded and installed, Windows Server 19 
   should have been downloaded and installed. Windows 10 Pro should have been installed for your client VM; Active Directory Domain Services should be 
     installed and configured.  And Group Policy Managment Console must also be installed on your Windows Server.
 

 <h2>Description</h2>
  In this lab we are going to set up File Services and File Sharing within Active Directory. We will create File sharing on a Windows Server and we will discuss
  what is Network Sharing, Permission Types, and how to implement File Service Resource Manager. So File and Folder Sharing is the practice of making all these
  resources available for memebers within your company to make edits, sharing and  modifying of files easier. There are two types of Network Sharing a)Local and 
  b) Network. There are also different types of Permission and Access Control ie; Read, Write, Full Control, and Execute. Third, we have two types of Permissions
  a) NTFS and b) Share. And finally, we have two types of Sharing Methods which are a)Mapped and b)Network

                   It is not applied to the sub-folders or files under it.</br>

<p align="center"> In NTFS one of the obvious main differences with that NTFS has more permissions. In NFTS you can apply permissions to the files and  
                   folder level. Permissions can be also applied to sub-folders here.</br>
